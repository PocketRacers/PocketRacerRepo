![final4 (1)-1](https://github.com/PocketRacers/PocketRacerRepo/assets/119138249/5c117452-3276-4f5c-b0bc-597bf2cf3c60)

## Project Description
Pocket Racer is a platform designed for simulating and training multi-agent autonomous racing models. Leveraging advanced transformer architectures, this platform enables the study and improvement of autonomous racing strategies in robotics education.

## Installation

To set up the Pocket Racer platform, please follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourgithub/pocket-racer.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd pocket-racer

# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

## Data Processing

To use the `data_processor.py` script for preparing and processing your datasets, run the following command:

```bash
python data_processor.py --n_stacked <number_of_stacked_images> --img_path <path_to_images> --csv_path <path_to_csv> --w <width> --h <height> --d <depth> --concatenate <concatenate_flag> --prediction_mode <mode>
```

Modify the parameters according to your dataset's requirements:

- **n_stacked**: Number of images to stack for input data.
- **img_path**: Path to the directory containing image files.
- **csv_path**: Path to the CSV file containing metadata or labels.
- **w, h, d**: Width, height, and depth of the processed images.
- **concatenate**: Boolean flag to determine whether to concatenate data.
- **prediction_mode**: Specifies the mode of prediction, e.g., 'linear' or 'categorical'.
## Training
To train the model using the provided scripts, you can run:

```bash
python train_script.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 1000
```

Modify the parameters as needed for your specific training setup.

## Features

- **Model Training**: Train vision transformers tailored for steering prediction.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluate model performance with metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and RÂ².
- **Customizable Training Options**: Configure training epochs, batch size, and image preprocessing through command-line arguments.
